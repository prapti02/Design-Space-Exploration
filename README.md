# Design-Space-Exploration

The provided framework allowed rapid exploration of the design space with minimum
simulation time. We were introduced to an architectural simulator called Simple Scalar
that enabled the exploration of multiple configurations with respect to two metrics -
Energy and Performance (time). Correlation of the metrics (edp and execution time) with
each parameter from the 18 dimensions was evaluated, observing how the performance
(and energy) metrics change with the change in each dimension value. The framework
enabled us to design efficient heuristics instead of brute force exhaustive search.
Further, pre-marking many design configurations invalid helped quicken the process of
exploration.
